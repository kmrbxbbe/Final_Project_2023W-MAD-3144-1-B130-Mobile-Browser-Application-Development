        Instruction


For this project, you are required to develop a website. The subject and contents of this website is left open, and you can come up with your own idea. For instance, you may represent a place such as “Taj Mahal”, or represent a hotel, or represent a visiting place such as “New York”. 
<br />

What to prepare: <br />

Your website MUST meet the following requirements:<br />
<ul>
	<li>At least 10 pages</li>
	<li>Responsive to mobile devices</li>
	<li>Apply Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) in all pages </li>
	<li>Apply JQuery or JavaScript to at least five pages</li>
	<li>Use all the html tags discussed during the class</li>
	<li>Follow all guidelines when designing webpages as discussed n class</li>
</ul>
Once developed, you are requested to design and develop three different CSS files to be used by the website. Your CSS must be thoughtful and previously planned, e.g., use meaningful names for different classes, ids, etc. You need to use the CSS so that the whole website can be re-styled by using different set of CSS files. Our goal is to change the website design by simply replacing the “.css” files with the existing ones. So, developing a well-designed architecture for each page and appropriate style for that page is well demanding.
<br />


To submit:<br />

In addition to your project files, you need to prepare a short report that elaborates on the following elements:<br />
<ul>
<li>	CSS styles that you have made and how they are applied to pages</li>
<li>	The challenges you had for this project and your solution</li>
<li>	Website Map</li>
<li>	Then include a one-page table like the one below regarding your 10 mobile specific HTML, CSS or JavaScript features:</li>
</ul>
