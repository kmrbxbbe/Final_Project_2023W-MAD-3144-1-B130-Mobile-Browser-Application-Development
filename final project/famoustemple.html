        <img src="/Users/bobbe/Downloads/final project/temples-harmandir-sahib-wallpaper-preview.jpg">
        <h3>The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib or Darbar Sahib, is a highly revered gurdwara or place of worship for Sikhs. It is located in the city of Amritsar, in the state of Punjab, India. The temple was founded by the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev, in 1604 and was rebuilt by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the early 19th century, with its stunning golden facade and marble walls, making it a magnificent example of Sikh architecture.

            The Golden Temple is surrounded by a large body of water, known as the Amrit Sarovar or pool of nectar, which is believed to have healing powers. The temple complex also includes a number of other buildings, including the Akal Takht, which is the highest temporal seat of the Sikh community and serves as the center of Sikh political and military power.
            
            The temple attracts millions of visitors every year, including pilgrims from all over the world who come to pay their respects to the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikh religion. The temple complex is also known for its exceptional hospitality, serving free meals or langar to all visitors regardless of their caste, religion or socio-economic status. The kitchen at the Golden Temple is the largest in the world, and the langar is prepared and served by volunteers from the Sikh community.
            
            The Golden Temple has a significant historical and cultural significance for Sikhs, as well as for people of other religions and nationalities. The temple was the site of a tragic incident in 1984, when it was attacked by the Indian Army during Operation Blue Star, resulting in the loss of many lives. The event remains a controversial chapter in Indian history and continues to be a source of tension between the Sikh community and the Indian government.
            
            Despite its tumultuous history, the Golden Temple remains a symbol of Sikh unity, equality, and religious tolerance. Its stunning architecture, historical significance, and welcoming atmosphere continue to draw visitors from all over the world.</h3>
